In this config you just need to put ip of second DHCP server node and local resolver, as well as DHCP settings for each zone.

Please, pay special attention to lines **61** and **80-83** in **dhcpd.conf.j2** and **dhcpd-sl.conf.j2**, 
where we declare our host dhcp settings. You can either set correct nic name and ansible will take care of the rest, or
hardcode macs and ips of the nodes in vars.

If you want to know about more different options for dhcp please use **man dhcp-options**. 

DNSSEC setting is set to **auto-dnssec**, it means that you don't need to sing zones youreself. Still you may need to generate DS records:

```
**dig dnskey example.net @localhost | dnssec-dsfromkey -f - example.net**
 ```
Change **example.net** to you domain and save the output, that's going to be sth like:

```
example.net. IN DS 50707 8 1 42727823EB40A1D93F0A1CF22E4AE8768BC40FBA
example.net. IN DS 50707 8 2 BC34B1EA3196C01EEFCC4C571B61753423D264A712E0A4F35847BBDC A5954A5F
```
The DS record is verifiable information (generated from one of the childâ€™s public keys) that a parent zone publishes about its child as part of the chain of trust.
